Time Series Database Evaluation
===============================

Head over to [chefdk](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) if you haven't already and grab a copy to start using this repo. Each subfolder has a wrapper cookbook and a [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) file to spin up a cluster of three machines at AWS. Those are possibly ridiculously underdimensioned for a real-world use case, but to get started, it should, well, be a start.
